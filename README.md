  ## Description
   This week's assignment was to create an application that users can use to automatically generate a team profile HTML page by answering prompts in the command line. It saves users a lot of time so all they have to worry about is entering in the unique information for each employee, and not have to code any HTML themselves. The application also includes four test files, so that future developers can easily come in and make updates and changes with the basic knowledge of the functionality documented for them.
   
   This project was mostly done in JavaScript, but I used HTML to bulid the string containing the HTML code so I could make sure that the syntax was correct. I also used a little bit of CSS to make my project my signature purple style.

  ## Installation
  The user must have a source code editor tool, such as VS Code, TextEdit on Mac, or NotePad on Windows. Additionally, the user will need node.js installed. 
  
  Once those tools are installed, hit the “code” button in this repository and copy the link. In your command line, type "git clone" followed by pasting the copied link to clone onto your own local machine. 
  
  Once you're in your project via the code editing software as well as in the command line, type "npm install" in your command line to ensure you have all the modules needed.

  
  ## Usage
  This application could be used for any projects for school, work, or just for fun.
  
  To start using this application, simply type “node index.js” into the command line. You will then get the first question, which is the name of the team's manager. After you answer, press enter and the next question will appear. 
  
  Every question requires an answer to be inputted. If the user tries to skip a question or types an invalid answer, the console will prompt a message saying to try again.

  After the user finishes inputting the manager's information, they will be asked if they would like to add another employee. If the user selects yes, the next prompt will ask if they'd like to input an Engineer or an Intern. After every completed employee input, they will be asked again if they'd like to add another one. Once the user has completed inputting employees, they can select "no" on that question and from there their HTML team profile page will generate in the "dist" directory.
